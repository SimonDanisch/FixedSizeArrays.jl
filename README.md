#### This package doesn't support 0.3

#### Packages that use FixedSizeArrays:
[GeometryTypes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/GeometryTypes.jl)

#### Usage and advantages:
FixedSizeArrays is giving any composite type array like behavior by inheriting from FixedSizeArrays.
So you can do something like this:
```Julia
immutable RGB{T} <: FixedVectorNoTuple{3, T}
    r::T
    g::T
    b::T
end
immutable Vec{N, T} <: FixedVector{N, T} # defined in FixedSizeArrays already
    _::NTuple{N, T}
end
Vec{3, Float32}(77) # constructor with 1 argument already defined
rand(Vec{3, Float64})+sin(Vec(0.,2.,2.)) # a lot of array functions are already defined
#There is also a matrix type
eye(Mat{3,3,Float32}) * rand(Vec{3, Float32}) # will also "just work"
a = Vec(1,2,3)[1:2] # returns (1,2)
```
Note that all of the above types are stack allocated and the speed of operations should be fairly fast!
If you find operations to be slow, please file a bug report!

FixedSizeArrays can be used in a lot of different ways.
You can define color types the same way, and arbitrary other point types like normals, vertices etc.
As they all inherit from FixedSizeArray, it's very easy to handle them in the same way.

For some more advantages, you can take a look at [MeshIO](https://github.com/JuliaIO/MeshIO.jl).

Because it's so easy to define different types like Point3, RGB, HSV or Normal3, one can create customized code for these types via multiple dispatch. This is great for visualizing data, as you can offer default visualizations based on the type.
Without FixedSizeArrays, this would end up in a lot of types which would all need to define the same functions over and over again.

#### FixedArray abstract types

The package provides several abstract types:

  * `FixedArray{T,D}` is the abstract base type for all fixed arrays with
    `T` the element type and `D` the number of dimensions.
  * The subtypes `FixedArray1{N,T}`, `FixedArray2{N,M,T}`, `FixedArray3{N,M,P,T}`,
    `FixedArray4{N,M,P,Q,T}`, are abstract base types for arrays of fixed
    dimensionality, with dimensionalities between 1 and 4.  Higher
    dimensionalities could be added easily if it made sense.  (Ideally we'd have
    the fixed size type parameters in FixedArray itself, but it's not clear how we
    can actually do this in a nice way.)
  * `FixedVectorNoTuple{N, T}` is the abstract type to use when you'd like to
    name the fields of a `FixedVector` explicitly rather than accessing them via
    an index.

There's some convenient type aliases:

  * `FixedVector{N,T}` is a type alias for `FixedArray1`.
  * `FixedMatrix{N,M,T}` is a type alias for `FixedArray2`.



#### FixedArray concrete types

The package currently provides five concrete FixedArray types

  * `Vec{N,T}` is a length `N` vector of element type `T`.
  * `Mat{N,M,T}` is an `N×M` matrix of element type `T`
  * `FArray3{N,M,P,T}` is an `N×M×P` array of element type `T`
  * `FArray4{N,M,P,Q,T}` is an `N×M×P×Q` array of element type `T`

These four types are intended to behave the same as `Base.Array` but with fixed
size.  That is, the interface is a convenient union of elementwise array-like
functionality and vector space / linear algebra operations.  Hopefully we'll
have more general higher dimensional fixed size containers in the future (note
that the total number of elements of a higher dimensional container quickly
grows beyond the size where having a fixed stack allocated container really
makes sense).

  * `Point{N,T}` is a generic member of an `N`-dimensional Cartesian space with element type `T`.

`Point{N,T}` is structurally the same as `Vec{N,T}`, but should be used to
represent position in an `N`-dimensional Cartesian space.  The distinction
between this and `Vec` is particularly relevant when overloading functions which
deal with geometric data.  For instance, a geometric transformation applies
differently depending on whether you're transforming a *position* (`Point`)
versus a *direction* (`Vec`).


#### User-supplied functions for FixedArray subtypes

Most array functionality comes for free when inheriting from one of the abstract
types `FixedArray`, `FixedVector`, `FixedMatrix`, or `FixedVectorNoTuple`.
However, the user may want to overload a few things.  At the moment,
`similar_type` is the main function you may want to customize.  The signature is

```julia
similar_type{FSA<:FixedArray, T, NDim}(::Type{FSA}, ::Type{T}, sz::NTuple{NDim,Int})
```

This is quite similar to `Base.similar` but the first argument is a type rather
than a value.  Given a custom FixedArray type, eltype and size, this function
should return a similar output type which will be used to store the results of
elementwise operations, general `map()` invocations, etc.

By default, `similar_type` introspects `FSA` to determine whether it can be
reparameterized by both `eltype(FSA) == T` and `size(FSA) == sz`.  If not, the
canonical concrete FixedArray type (a `Vec` or `Mat`) are returned by calling
the fallback `similar_type(FixedArray, T, sz)`.  Sometimes this may not make
sense for your custom FixedArray subtype.

For example, suppose you define the type `RGB{T}` as above, and you'd prefer
relational operators to return a `Vec{3,Bool}` as a mask rather than an
`RGB{Bool}`.  In this case you could write something like:

```julia
function FixedSizeArrays.similar_type{FSA<:RGB,T}(::Type{FSA}, ::Type{T}, n::Tuple{Int})
    n == (3,) && T != Bool ? RGB{T} : similar_type(FixedArray, T, n)
end
```

We then have `RGB(1,2,3) .< RGB(2,2,2) === Vec{3,Bool}(true,false,false)`.

Note that `similar_type` isn't type stable in julia-0.4.  For the internal
use in `FixedSizeArrays` (type deduction inside `@generated` functions) this
isn't a problem, but you may want to annotate your custom overlads with
`Base.@pure` if you're using julia-0.5 and you want to use `similar_type` in a
normal function.
